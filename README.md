# My Pile of Shame

This is a hobby diary in the form of a blog website. The phrase pile of shame is a common one that refers to the stuff, usually miniatures or models, that you haven't painted or built yet. This starts to accumulate, and you end up with a big catalog of models that you haven't used as you continue to buy more.
 The purpose of this website is to publish my progress and to motivate me to finish the pile of models I have accumulated in the last year.
